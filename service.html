            <h2>Service</h2>
            <p>I strive to serve my community in many diverse ways: in high school I was an instructor for 
                <a href="https://www.steelcitycodes.org/">Steel City Codes</a>, 
                an organization dedicated to introducing elementary and middle schoolers to programming. 
                I taught both Python and Java, drawing on my expertise from my high school courses to reach out to younger students. 
                I found it a great way to serve my community using my love for computer science, 
                and in the future I would love to become a TA or Peer Teacher for computer science courses here at Texas A&M.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>I am also heavily involved with the alumni chapter of Science Olympiad; 
                I competed in Science Olympiad during my high school years and wanted to continue contributing to the community after I graduated. 
                Science Olympiad is a nonprofit organization focused on fostering an appreciation for the world of science through tournaments 
                and bettering secondary school science education in a fun and engaging way. 
                <a href="https://www.soinc.org/">Learn more about Science Olympiad here.</a>
                I started writing tests and volunteering for tournaments during my freshman year of undergraduate, 
                spanning over forty different tournaments across the nation over the past couple of years. 
                <a href="https://scioly.org/wiki/User:RZ2004#Volunteering/Testwriting:">Here is a link to a summary of my tournament volunteering experience.</a>
            </p>
            <p>Besides helping out at tournaments, I am the current treasurer for <a href="https://tamuscioly.com/">Texas A&M Science Olympiad Society</a>, 
                a student organization focused on serving middle and high school students through hosting our own Science Olympiad Tournament 
                and conducting outreach events such as Science Night and demonstrations.
                I manage the funds and help run the social media account of the organization, and I design merchandise to sell at tournaments as well.
                I also serve as a moderator for an <a href="https://scioly.org/">online community of over 11,000 fellow Science Olympiad enthusiasts</a>,
                making sure conversations are appropriate and on-topic. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>I firmly believe that serving is extremely important: not only does it benefit the community but it also allows for personal growth.
                It addresses issues in society today and brings people closer together, which is more important than ever in a modern, globalised world.
                It also gives a sense of personal fulfillment and purpose, providing knowledge of new skills and experiences.
                I hope to keep serving my community, bringing joy and a love for learning to the people around me.

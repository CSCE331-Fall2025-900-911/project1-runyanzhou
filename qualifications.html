            <p>I am a member of the Texas A&M Engineering Honors program in Computer Science, having fulfilled all previous requirements to stay in the program including maintaining a high GPA.
            </p>
            <p>During my time at Texas A&M, I have taken many courses in computer science. CSCE 120 (introduction to programming), 221 (data structures and algorithms),
                222 (discrete structures), 312 (computer organization), 314 (programming languages), 411 (algorithms), 421 (machine learning), and 441 (computer graphics) are some of the courses I have taken so far.
                I have background in many different computer science topics, and I did well in all of these courses, earning A's in all of them.
                Currently I am taking 313 (computer systems), 331 (software engineering), 436 (human-computer interaction), and 477 (cybersecurity risk).
            </p>
            <p>Over the past two summers, I have held two internships. 
                <li>During summer 2024, I worked at MicroMaterials LLC, a chemical start-up company for manufacturing silica nanoparticles. My research allowed for a more effective production process as I looked into automation systems, and the products I helped manufacture were then used in industry
                Additionally I used AI as a tool to help me collect data on other companies attending a conference, and I helped design a website for the startup.</li>
                <li>During summer 2025 (this past summer), I was an intern at LandTech Incorporation. I worked to draft plans and maps from land surveying using CAD, and I also used the programming language associated with CAD to streamline the design process. </li>

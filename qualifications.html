            <h3>Education</h3>
            <p>I am a member of the Texas A&M Engineering Honors program in Computer Science, having fulfilled all previous requirements to stay in the program including maintaining a high GPA.</p>
            <p>During my time at Texas A&M, I have taken many courses in computer science:
                <li>120 (introduction to programming) - Spring 2024</li> 
                <li>221 (data structures and algorithms) - Fall 2024</li>
                <li>222 (discrete structures) - Fall 2024</li>
                <li>314 (programming languages) - Fall 2024</li>
                <li>312 (computer organization) - Spring 2025</li>
                <li>411 (design and analysis of algorithms) - Spring 2025</li>
                <li>421 (machine learning) - Spring 2025</li>
                <li>441 (computer graphics) - Spring 2025</li>
            <p>I have background in many different computer science topics, and I did well in all of these courses, earning A's in all of them.
            </p>
            <p>
                Currently I am taking 
                <li>313 (computer systems)</li>
                <li>331 (software engineering)</li>
                <li>436 (human-computer interaction)</li>
                <li>477 (cybersecurity risk)</li>
            </p>
            <h3>Professional Experience</h3>
            <p>Over the past two summers, I have held two internships. 
                <li>During summer 2024, I worked at MicroMaterials LLC, a chemical start-up company for manufacturing silica nanoparticles. My research allowed for a more effective production process as I looked into automation systems, and the products I helped manufacture were then used in industry
                Additionally I used AI as a tool to help me collect data on other companies attending a conference, and I helped design a website for the startup.</li>
                <li>During summer 2025 (this past summer), I was an intern at LandTech Incorporation. I worked to draft plans and maps from land surveying using CAD, and I also used the programming language associated with CAD to streamline the design process. </li>
            </p>
            <h3>Programming Experience</h3>
            <h3>Extracurriculars and Leadership</h3>
            <p>Outside of coursework and internships, I have also been involved with computer science-related extracurriculars.</p>
